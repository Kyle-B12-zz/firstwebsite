    <h1><i class="em em-two_hearts"></i>All About Tristan<i class="em em-two_hearts"></i></h1>
    <p> Tristan is a very interesting creature, he is a strong boy, he has a weird sense of humor and is a self hating loser (his words not mine) but he is also a sweet nice boy who is just in need of a girl he can love and spend his time with. His perfect girl is of that an interesting type, for all things body type he's going for a girl with a flat chest, big butt, and medium length hair but if you don't meet these requirements then don't fret because Tristan Brett Korth is not the type of guy to only care about looks and body types. He needs a loving, kind, nice, cute, fun girl that just wants to spend time together and really get to know each other. Now some things about biston that are good to know would be that he loves to play video games he's got an Xbox One and a PC, but he mostly spends his time on the Xbox, and he loves to talk about memes and any subject he feels strongly about (which is a lot of them). He can get angry if things don't work like his PC if there's a problem he won't stay calm for long, but he's a kind gentle guy, he is big on the fact that there is spyware out there, and he is very cautious about it. When you wrap that all up he's a very great guy and can be a wonderful boyfriend. He hopes to hear from you soon! </p>
